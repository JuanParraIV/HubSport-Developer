## Study Questions:
- **Q: What options can you find in the design manager?**
  - A: In the design manager of HubSpot CMS, you can find options such as templates, modules, global content, stylesheets, and custom HTML. These options allow you to customize and manage the design and layout of your website. Templates and modules provide pre-built components that can be used to create and update pages, while global content allows you to create reusable content across multiple pages. Stylesheets and custom HTML give you the flexibility to customize the appearance and functionality of your website further.

- **Q: What options can you find in the content editor?**
  - A: The content editor in HubSpot CMS provides options for creating and editing content on your website. Some of the common options you can find include text formatting tools (such as headings, lists, and styles), media insertion (images, videos), hyperlinking, source code editing, previewing, and publishing content. The content editor is designed to make it easy for you to create engaging and well-formatted content for your website's pages and blog posts.

- **Q: How can you connect to your HubSpot account using the CLI?**
  - A: To connect to your HubSpot account using the Command Line Interface (CLI), you would typically use the HubSpot API. You can authenticate your account by providing your API key or using OAuth 2.0 authentication. Once authenticated, you can use the CLI commands to interact with your HubSpot account, perform various operations, and manage your content and data programmatically.

- **Q: What are the most important site settings?**
  - A: The most important site settings in a content management system like HubSpot CMS can vary depending on your specific needs. However, some commonly important site settings include domain configuration (setting up your custom domain), SSL certificate setup (for secure HTTPS connections), site name and description (metadata for SEO and branding), metadata settings (such as title tags and meta descriptions), and access control permissions (managing user roles and permissions). These settings are crucial for configuring your website's functionality, security, SEO, and access control.

- **Q: Why is it important to know about the site settings that are available?**
  - A: It is important to know about the available site settings because they allow you to customize and configure your website according to your specific needs. Site settings control various aspects of your website, such as domain, security, metadata, and access permissions. Understanding and properly configuring these settings ensure that your website functions correctly, is secure, and aligns with your branding and marketing goals. Proper site settings also contribute to better search engine visibility and user experience.
  
- **Q: How can you create and implement navigation menus in the CMS?**
  - A: In HubSpot CMS, you can create and implement navigation menus by using the site navigation settings. You can define the menu structure, create menu items, and configure their hierarchy and appearance. The CMS typically provides a user-friendly interface where you can add links to pages, external URLs, and even anchor links within the same page. By setting up navigation menus, you can create a clear and organized navigation structure for visitors to easily navigate through your website.

- **Q: What file details can you find in the file manager?**
  - A: In the file manager of HubSpot CMS, you can find details about the files stored in your CMS. These details include the file name, file type, file size, date uploaded, and file URL. Additionally, you may have the option to add custom properties or metadata to files for better organization and categorization. The file manager helps you organize and manage the files used in your website's content, design, and assets, making it easier to locate and use them efficiently.
