# How will you connect your App to HubSpot
## What's the best way for users to access your app?

## HubSpot:
- **API Key:**
  - **Permissions Granted:** The API Key grants the user full access to the entire HubSpot instance, essentially functioning as a "GOD mode" with broad access permissions. However, please note that this authentication method is not preferred and will be deprecated in the future.
  - **Use Case:** The API Key is a good fit for initial development when you want to quickly start working with the HubSpot APIs and haven't determined the specific permissions you'll need yet.
  - **Transition to Other Methods:** It's important to plan for transitioning away from API Key authentication to a more permanent and secure method in the future. As part of your internal security policies, the API Key should be rotated periodically to maintain security.
  - **Generating an API Key:** You can generate an API key in your HubSpot account by navigating to Settings -> Integrations -> API key.
  - **Usage:** API keys are commonly used for server-to-server integrations or when accessing the HubSpot APIs from scripts or command-line tools.


- **OAuth:**
  - **Permissions Granted:** OAuth grants limited access to HubSpot based on the permissions set by the development team. The access tokens obtained through OAuth may need to be replaced periodically for security reasons.
  - **Use Case**: OAuth is a good fit when you're creating a new app for public use and want to ensure that your app only accesses a user's HubSpot account with their explicit consent. This helps mitigate risks for both parties involved. OAuth is also required for app certification.
  - **Managing API Limits**: If you ever encounter API limits, you can create another HubSpot app using OAuth. API limits are based on the combination of the user and the app, so creating a new app allows you to have separate API limits for different users.
  - **Secure and Recommended Method**: OAuth is a more secure and recommended authentication method for third-party integrations with HubSpot.
  - **How it Works**: To use OAuth, you need to create an app in the HubSpot Developer Dashboard and configure the necessary OAuth scopes and redirect URLs.
  - **Authorization and Access Tokens**: When a user authorizes your app, you receive an access token, which you can use to make API requests on their behalf.
  - **Use Cases**: OAuth is commonly used for applications that require access to specific user data and need to authenticate as individual users. OAuth provides a more granular and secure approach to accessing HubSpot data, as users have control over which apps can access their accounts.

- **Private Application:**
  - **Permissions Granted:** Private applications provide ease of use similar to API keys, but with the added capability of accessing CRM data. However, it's important to note that this feature is still maturing.
  - **Use Case:** Private applications are a good fit when you're creating an app that won't be used by the general public and you don't need to manage OAuth tokens. It allows you to set permissions to limit access to only what is necessary for your app's functionality.
  - **Limitations:** One important caveat is that the CRM card cannot be used with private applications at the moment.
  - **Creating a Private Application:** You can create a private application in the HubSpot Developer Dashboard.
  - **Authentication with OAuth:** Private applications use OAuth 2.0 for authentication, similar to other OAuth integrations.
  - **Purpose:** Private applications are particularly useful when you want to automate tasks or build custom functionality within your own HubSpot account.
Private applications offer the convenience of API keys while enabling access to CRM data. They are a suitable choice when developing apps for internal use or for specific accounts without the need for managing OAuth tokens.

- **Developer API Key:**
  - **Permissions Granted:** Developer API keys are specifically used for accessing certain HubSpot APIs that require additional permissions. These keys provide access to APIs such as the CMS API or Ecommerce Bridge API, which may have more specific functionality and data access.
  - **Use Case:** Developer API keys are primarily used in specific situations, such as when creating workflow actions for your app and needing to manage the workflow node UI that appears in HubSpot. These keys offer more granular control over access to specific APIs.
  - **Generating Developer API Keys:** You can generate Developer API keys in the HubSpot Developer Dashboard.
  - **Granular Control:** Developer API keys are separate from regular API keys and provide the ability to manage access to specific APIs that require additional permissions.
