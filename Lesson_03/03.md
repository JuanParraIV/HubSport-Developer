In most cases, templates are created using HTML and CSS to define the structure and appearance of the page. By separating the template from the content, you can easily apply the same design to multiple pages.

  - Document templates: Used to define the structure and formatting of documents.
  - Presentation templates: Used to create consistent slide designs for presentations.
  - CMS templates: Used in content management systems to define the layout of web pages.

- **Q: How can you create a good editor experience when building templates?**
  - A: To create a good editor experience when building templates, consider the following:
  - Provide a user-friendly interface with intuitive controls and options.
  - Offer a visual editor that allows users to see the changes in real time.
  - Include helpful features like drag-and-drop functionality and live previews.
  - Allow customization of the template while maintaining its overall structure.
  - Provide clear documentation and guidance on how to use and customize the template.

- **Q: How do you create a page from a template?**
  - A: To create a page from a template, you typically follow these steps:
  - Choose a template that suits your needs.
  - Open the template in an editor or content management system.
  - Replace the placeholder content with your own text, images, and other media.
  - Customize the template's settings, such as colors, fonts, and layout if needed.
  - Save the page as a new file or publish it directly to your website.

- **Q: How do you use drag-and-drop areas in templates?**
  - A: Drag-and-drop areas in templates allow users to easily rearrange and customize the layout of a page. By dragging and dropping elements within these designated areas, users can reposition them or add new elements. This provides flexibility and convenience when building pages from templates, as it eliminates the need for manual coding or complex editing processes.
