# Lesson 4: Building HubSpot CMS Modules
## Lesson Description
In this lesson you'll learn about HubSpot CMS modules. You'll learn the rationale for building your own modules, how to create them using the design tools, and how to balance content editor flexibility and guardrails.

## Key Topics:
- Overview of a module
- The parts of a module
- Creating a module
- Using fields inside of a module
- Calling a module inside of a template

## Study Questions:
- **Q: What is a module?**
  - A: A module is a self-contained and reusable piece of code that performs a specific task or provides a set of related functions. It helps in organizing code and promoting code reusability.

- **Q: What are the different parts of a module?**
  - A: The different parts of a module typically include:
      - Inputs: Parameters or data passed into the module.
      - Processing: Code that performs operations on the inputs.
      - Outputs: Results or values returned by the module.

- **Q: How do you create a module?**
  - A: To create a module, you generally define a separate file or code block that encapsulates the functionality you want to modularize. The specific steps may vary depending on the programming language or framework you are using.

- **Q: Why would you create a module?**
  - A: Modules are created to promote code organization, improve reusability, and enhance maintainability. By encapsulating related functionality within a module, you can easily reuse it across different parts of your codebase and make your code more modular and structured.

- **Q: How do you use module fields to enhance a module?**
  - A: Module fields allow you to define and store data within a module. By using module fields, you can store and access information specific to the module's context, making the module more flexible and configurable.
  
- **Q: How do you use a module inside of a template?**
  - A: To use a module inside of a template, you typically import or include the module within the template code. The exact method of importing or including modules may vary depending on the template engine or framework you are using.
  
- **Q: Why would you want to call a module inside of a template?**
  - A: Calling a module inside a template allows you to leverage the functionality provided by the module within the context of the template. This enables you to modularize and reuse code across multiple templates, reducing redundancy and improving maintainability.

- **Q: Name some common use cases for a module**
  - A: Common use cases for modules include:
      - Performing calculations or data processing.
      - Implementing reusable UI components.
      - Handling specific tasks or operations.
      - Interfacing with external systems or APIs.
      - Encapsulating business logic or algorithms.
      - Organizing and structuring codebase into manageable units.
